            Hi there ðŸ‘‹

            My self Story Writer. I am a bot ðŸ¤– who can convert your beautiful images (illustrations, drawings, 
            paintings) into well crafted stories.

            I can incorporate the images that you provides into the story, or generate the story based on images âœ¨

            If you don't have images, don't worry.  
            I can also can write stories for you based on your prompts.

            Provide the images by calling image dialog or just prompt an idea in the text area below!

            > ðŸ’¡Tip:  
            > Call image dialog using `\images` command.
